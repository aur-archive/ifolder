This package has been tested for client mode only. If you want to setup an ifolder server, you probably
have to perform some additional steps and/or modifications to the build process. Please send any patches
my way so I can integrate them.

Known problems:
---------------

- X sometimes freezes when starting iFolders, have to switch to console and kill
  the mono process, then try again

- Doesn't initialize properly when run for a user with encrypted home or other nonstandard home (network
  mounted home probably won't work either). Workaround:
    sudo mkdir /simias #or other locally normal mounted location
    sudo chown yourusername:users /simias
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share
    ln -s /simias ~/.local/share/simias

  After that it should start. After the first start, you can move the /simias folder to ~/.local/share.
